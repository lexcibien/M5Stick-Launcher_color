## With M5Launcher you'll be able to:
### OTA Update
- Install binaries from M5Burner repository (yes, online, without the need of a USB Cable)
- Install binaries from a WebUI, that you can start from CFG option, installing binaries you have on your computer or smartphone
- Install binaries from your SD Card

### SD Card Management
- Create new Folders,
- Delete files and folders,
- Rename files,
- Copy and paste files,
- Install binaries

### Customization
- You can change brightness
- change rotation (StickCs)
- Start WebUI
- set to see all files on SD Card (see only .bins is default)
